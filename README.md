*Disclaimer
This game is a work in progress and does not reflect the final version. There will likely be bugs.

This is an idle game focused on technological development. Knowledge is power, and with great power comes great responsibility...



Currently this is just a bare-bones example with only the main game mechanics implemented, but many more features are planned!
This includes, but is not limited to: 

World domination
Creating a cult
Minigames!


I'm using this as a place to practice creating various game mechanics to improve my skills for use in future projects.
